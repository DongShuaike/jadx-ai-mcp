## 🤖 What is JADX-AI-MCP?

**JADX-AI-MCP** is a plugin for the [JADX decompiler](https://github.com/skylot/jadx) that integrates directly with [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/anthropic/mcp) to provide **live reverse engineering support with LLMs like Claude**.

Think: "Decompile → Context-Aware Code Review → AI Recommendations" — all in real time.

Watch the demos!

- **Perform quick analysis**

- **Analyze The APK Resources**

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f42d8072-0e3e-4f03-93ea-121af4e66eb1

It is combination of two tools:
1. JADX-AI-MCP
2. [JADX MCP SERVER](https://github.com/zinja-coder/jadx-mcp-server)

## 🤖 What is JADX-MCP-SERVER?

**JADX MCP Server** is a standalone Python server that interacts with a `JADX-AI-MCP` plugin (see: [jadx-ai-mcp](https://github.com/zinja-coder/jadx-ai-mcp)) via MCP (Model Context Protocol). It lets LLMs communicate with the decompiled Android app context live.

## 🛠️ Getting Started 

### 1. Download from Releases: https://github.com/zinja-coder/jadx-ai-mcp/releases

> [!NOTE]
>
> Download both `jadx-ai-mcp-<version>.jar` and `jadx-mcp-server-<version>.zip` files.


```bash
# 0. Download the jadx-ai-mcp-<version>.jar and jadx-mcp-server-<version>.zip
https://github.com/zinja-coder/jadx-ai-mcp/releases

# 1. 
unzip jadx-ai-mcp-<version>.zip

├jadx-mcp-server/
  ├── jadx_mcp.py
  ├── requirements.txt
  ├── README.md
  ├── LICENSE

├jadx-ai-mcp-<version>.jar

# 2. Install the plugin

# For this you can follow two approaches:

## 1. One liner - execute below command in your shell
jadx plugins --install "github:zinja-coder:jadx-ai-mcp"

## The above one line code will install the latest version of the plugin directly into the jadx, no need to download the jadx-ai-mcp's .jar file.
## 2. Or you can use JADX-GUI to install it by following images as shown below:
```

<div align="center">
    <img alt="banner" height="480px" widht="620px" src="docs/assets/img_1231.png">
</div>

<div align="center">
    <img alt="banner" height="480px" widht="620px" src="docs/assets/img_1123.png">
</div>

<div align="center">
    <img alt="banner" height="480px" widht="620px" src="docs/assets/img_2122.png">
</div>


```bash
## 3. GUI method, download the .jar file and follow below steps shown in images
```
![img.png](docs/assets/img123.png)
![img_1.png](docs/assets/img_12.png)
![img_2.png](docs/assets/img_2.png)
![img_3.png](docs/assets/img_3.png)
```bash
# 3. Navigate to jadx-mcp-server directory
cd jadx-mcp-server

# 4. This project uses uv - https://github.com/astral-sh/uv instead of pip for dependency management.
    ## a. Install uv (if you dont have it yet)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ## b. OPTIONAL, if for any reasons, you get dependecy errors in jadx-mcp-server, Set up the environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
    ## c. OPTIONAL Install dependencies
uv pip install httpx fastmcp

# The setup for jadx-ai-mcp and jadx_mcp_server is done.
```

## 2. Running on Local LLM Using Ollama and Zin MCP Client - Recommended

<div align="center">
    <a href="https://github.com/zinja-coder/zin-mcp-client">
    <img alt="zin-mcp-client" height="360px" widht="480px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e8e0ecd-0520-422e-a007-03dc62c4118e">

## 🤖 3. Use Claude Desktop

Make sure Claude Desktop is running with MCP enabled.

For instance, I have used following for Kali Linux: https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian

Configure and add MCP server to LLM file:
```bash
nano ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

For:
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   
And following content in it:
```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "jadx-mcp-server": {
            "command": "/<path>/<to>/uv", 
            "args": [
                "--directory",
                "</PATH/TO/>jadx-mcp-server/",
                "run",
                "jadx_mcp_server.py"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Replace:

- `path/to/uv` with the actual path to your `uv` executable
- `path/to/jadx-mcp-server` with the absolute path to where you cloned this
repository

Then, navigate code and interact via real-time code review prompts using the built-in integration.

**OR**

or you can install the jadx_mcp_server directly as executable directly using below command:

```
uv tool install git+https://github.com/zinja-coder/jadx-mcp-server
```

and then you can just provide `jadx_mcp_server` in `command` section of mcp configuration.

## 4. Use Cherry Studio

If you want to configure the MCP tool in Cherry Studio, you can refer to the following configuration.
- Type: stdio
- command: uv
- argument:
```bash
--directory
path/to/jadx-mcp-server
run
jadx_mcp_server.py
```
- `path/to/jadx-mcp-server` with the absolute path to where you cloned this
repository

## 5. Using LMStudio

You can also use JADX AI MCP Server with LM Studio by configuring it's mcp.json file. Here's the video guide.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4a6b280-5aa9-4e76-ac72-a0abec73b809

## 6. Running in HTTP Stream Mode

You can also use Jadx in HTTP Stream Mode using `--http` option with `jadx_mcp_server.py` as shown in following:

```bash
uv run jadx_mcp_server.py --http

OR

uv run jadx_mcp_server.py --http --port 9999
```

## 7. Custom port configuration for JADX AI MCP Plugin

<img width="800" height="335" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6243adc5-5be4-4e2d-aa16-bdaf78a28e36" />

1. Configure Port: Configure the port on which the JADX AI MCP Plugin will listen on.
2. Default Port: Revert back the changes and listen on default port.
3. Restart Server: Force restart the JADX AI MCP Plugin server.
4. Server Status: Check the status of JADX AI MCP Plugin server.

To connect with JADX AI MCP Plugin running on custom port, the `--jadx-port` option will be used as shown in following:
```
uv run jadx_mcp_server.py --jadx-port 8652
```

The MCP Configuration for above will be as follows for claude:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jadx-mcp-server": {
      "command": "/path/to/uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/jadx-mcp-server/",
        "run",
        "jadx_mcp_server.py",
        "--jadx-port",
        "8652"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Give it a shot

1. Run jadx-gui and load any .apk file

![img_1.png](docs/assets/img_1.png)

2. Start claude - You must see hammer symbol

![img2.png](docs/assets/img2.png)

3. Click on the `hammer` symbol and you should you see somthing like following:

![img3.png](docs/assets/img3.png)

4. Run following prompt:
```text
fetch currently selected class and perform quick sast on it
```
![img4.png](docs/assets/img4.png)

5. Allow access when prompted:

![img_1.png](docs/assets/img5.png)

6. HACK!

![img_2.png](docs/assets/img6.png)

This plugin allows total control over the GUI and internal project model to support deeper LLM integration, including:

- Exporting selected class to MCP
- Running automated Claude analysis
- Receiving back suggestions inline

## 🛣️ Future Roadmap

- [x] Add Support for apktool

 - [ ] Add support for hermes code (ReactNative Application)

 - [ ] Add more useful MCP Tools

 - [ ] Make LLM be able to modify code on JADX

 - [ ] Add prompts templates, give llm access to Android APK Files as Resources

 - [x] Build MCP Client to support Local LLM

 - [ ] **END-GOAL** : Make all android reverse engineering and APK modification tools Connect with single MCP server to make reverse engineering apk files as easy as possible purely from vibes.

## 🙏 Credits

This project is a plugin for JADX, an amazing open-source Android decompiler created and maintained by [@skylot](https://github.com/skylot). All core decompilation logic belongs to them. I have only extended it to support my MCP server with AI capabilities.

[📎 Original README (JADX)](https://github.com/skylot/jadx)

The original README.md from jadx is included here in this repository for reference and credit.

This MCP server is made possible by the extensibility of JADX-GUI and the amazing Android reverse engineering community.

Also huge thanks to [@aaddrick](https://github.com/aaddrick) for developing Claude desktop for Debian based linux.

And in last thanks to [@anthropics](https://github.com/anthropics) for developing the Model Context Protocol and [@FastMCP](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk) team

Apart from this, huge thanks to all open source projects which serve as a dependencies for this project and which made this possible.
